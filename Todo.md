Using the app developed in Task 1, please:

Add a logging system to the app. The app should log out its logs (minimum INFO level) in a repo /logs/logs.log
Dockerize the app using Composer. There should be a Dockerfile and a docker-compose.yml file in the code repo.
Add three small instruction sections in the  README.md file under a title called “How to run the app” about:
What command to use to build the image using Composer
What command to run the app with Composer
What command stops the app from using Composer?
You can update the same codebase from Task 1.
